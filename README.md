# LibrettyKey
Repository for the BIOS unlock PCB for the Toshiba Libretto line of notebooks. Currently this only works for the 50CT (and possibly 70CT). This technique can be used for other models, but they have different size and pinouts for the dock connector, so it would need to be adapted. Feel free to submit a PR if you end up doing one of your own!

## 50CT / 70CT
![PCB Layout for the LibrettyKey50 v3](/models/50CT/images/pcb_layout.png)

The current version is for the 50CT. This may also work on the 70CT as well as it has the same 132 pin PJ2 Docking I/F Connector - but it has not been tested.
